# dafty-website

Website made for Daftyfox.

## Requirements

- Server to run/Xampp
- Text-editor (I recommend VSC)



## Project Notes

For gradient effect in background I used website "https://www.gradient-animator.com/"



## Design Notes

Gradient effect in background could break the page when scrolling/zooming that's why I removed ability to zoom on my page, and turned of the gradient on /html/links.html page.

Icons made by me in photoshop. First I wanted to make them in a inline but,  flex-warp is actually better.
